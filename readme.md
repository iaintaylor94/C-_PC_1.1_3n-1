## Problem 1.1 3n + 1[^1]
### Problem description
The "3n + 1" algorithm generates a series of integers, starting from a "seed" and terminated by 1. The sequence has a specific length. This program reads two integers (stored on one line) and calculates the maximum length of a sequence generated by using a seed between these two boundaries. The input followed by the result is printed on one line.


### Example 
>**Input**                                                                 
>1 10
>100 200
>201 210
>900 1000                                              

>**Output**                            
>1 10 20                                                 
>100 200 125
>201 210 89
>900 1000 174                                       


### Problem solution
1. The program will read in the two input boundaries.
2. A maximum variable will be set to 0
3. The length of each sequence will be computed, if it is greater than the max variable, the max will be set to this new integer
4. The input followed by the max variable is output
5. If there is more input - return to step 1
6. Else end program
